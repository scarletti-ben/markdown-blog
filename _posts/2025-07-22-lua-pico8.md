# PICO-8 Games with LUA

## The PICO-8
In the game [Celeste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celeste_(video_game)) there is a minigame in which you play a retro-style version of the game on a little console called `PICO-8`. It turns out that the original version of `Celeste` was actually made for the real [PICO-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PICO-8) which is a virtual machine / game engine that resembles a retro game console with a command-line interface / terminal that runs `Lua` code to create simple pixel-art games. 

The benefits are that `PICO-8` runs across many systems eg.`Windows`, `Mac`, `Linux` and on the web. And that you can export `PICO-8` games as "cartridges" which are actually `.png` images that contain all the data for your game, in the `.p8.png` format

There are significant limitations, namely a 16-colour palette, 128x128 pixel resolution, and a hard cap of 8192 tokens for your code, but these limitations create simplicity and form part of the benefits listed above. You can read the FAQ for `PICO-8` [here](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php?page=faq)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In order to create, export, and distribute`.p8.png` game cartridges, or standalone `HTML5` files for `PICO-8` you need to buy a license

## Playing PICO-8 Games
You can access and play any game in the `PICO-8` repository [here](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php), including the original version of `Celeste` which can be played [here](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=2145)

## Creating PICO-8 Games

### Creating PICO-8 Games without a License
Users without a license can write and run games at the using the free `PICO-8 Education Edition` which can be accessed [here](https://www.pico-8-edu.com/). This is a feature-complete version of the `PICO-8` with the ability to write, load, save and run `Lua` code for `PICO-8` games. It is missing the functionality to export to `.p8.png` or `.js` / `.html` but it allows you to save files as `.p8` files. An example `.p8.png` file can be found [here](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/cposts/to/top_speed-3.p8.png)

### Creating PICO-8 Games with a License
For a licensed user you would write or load `Lua` code into `PICO-8` and either export to `.p8.png` or export to an entirely self contained project that contains files in a structure that resembles the directory tree below. You would be able to host this on a static site eg. `GitHub` pages, as long as you give correct attribution for `pico8.wasm`. Additionally you could also use this to play the game entirely locally. You can read more about the export process [here](https://pico-8.fandom.com/wiki/Export)

## Embedding PICO-8 Games
You can embed games that have been published to the [lexaloffle](https://www.lexaloffle.com) site within your own site via an `<iframe>`. You can find the "embed" button at the bottom of any game on `lexaloffle`

```html
<iframe src="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/widget.php?pid=53976" allowfullscreen width="621" height="513" style="border:none; overflow:hidden"></iframe>
```

You can also add the cartridge image within a clickable link with code similar to the `<a>` tag below
```html
<a href="http://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?pid=12030" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/cposts/4/40278.p8.png" title="⭐135─Tempest - Survive the harsh elements through salvaging nature. 🎮by impbox" alt="image"></a>
