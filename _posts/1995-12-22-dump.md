Implement Firebase App Check with reCAPTCHA v3 that creates an invisible challenge to the browser / user
App Check automatically attaches tokens to all Firebase requests
This gives some protection to bots

Windwaker save file location
- GCI folder vs Game card file

Dolphin Emulator
- dolphin-x64 v2503
- Before first run add `portable.txt` file to the dolphin folder
   - Be extra careful that the file has not been named `portable.txt.txt`
- Add a Roms folder, and add that to paths for Dolphin
- Edit User/Config/Dolphin.ini to have Roms as a relative path instead of absolute
- Edit User/Config/Dolphin.ini to have WFS as a relative path instead of absolute
- Make sure all paths in Settings/Paths start with User
- Ensure nothing has been written to app data roaming
- Replace the contents of User/GC with correct save files

# VSCode
- You can search all repositories on your account for any text in a filename or within a file

From what I have experienced so far, you'll need the functions only for Firebase admin utilities. And since most of my projects use Next.js, I can use the easy-to-use serverless API feature of the framework for any Firebase admin needs. Also, Next.js projects can be deployed on Vercel, a production grade hosting platform created by Next.js creators themeselves, with minimal configurations. All in all, I have deployed 2 production level projects using the Firebase-Next-Vercel combo and I have had to pay $0 so far.

Screnshot (245) - Set up sign in for the site
- Ignore SHA warning, it is for android apps
- Just enable it and give the project a name and support email

Screnshot (246) - Add localhost to authorised domains
- Go to authentication / settings / authorised domains


There are lots of files when you setup a firebase project, but most are for backend use, and you can get away with the CDN usage to interface with the firebase backend - easiest if you use some sort of authorisation


Screenshot (247) - Authorisation for `Firebase` is done via `IndexedDB` instead of `localStorage`
- Stored as firebaseLocalStorageDb/firebaseLocalStorage
- This is automatically read / written via `getAuth` from `firebase-auth`

# Firestore
- Both firstore and realtime database are json trees
- Firestore has a "add collection" button


# Learnings
- indexedDB allows persistent storage of objects, where localStorage only allows strings
- indexedDB allows single key / value pair manipulation
    - it is asynchronous
- SDK is a Software Developement Kit

# Ideas
- Google auth to get openAI key to use on site? as a token or somethin

Pure JavaScript Reference Guide
- Use void keyword to discard the return value of a function call or expression
- Components are javascript files that are self contained and control their own styling / css / functionality
- Synchronous code with Promise chaining via .then might be advisable for games in the sense that you can pass something off to be executed later, while also giving a callback to run when that does get executed
- Promise has resolve in its callback thats passed, and when the resolve is called resolve(), that result is passed to .then, the function in then should be expecting one argument "result"
- Connected callback fires again if it is an object that moves containers, or if it is a child of an object that moves containers

You can test `HTML` / `CSS` / `JavaScript` on [`GitHub Codespaces`](https://github.com/features/codespaces) using `npm install -g live-server` then `live-server`

A `codespace` stays active for about 30 minutes after you close the tab, and will continue running any server that you initiate.

It creates localhost type sites at `GitHub` URLs that you can access via another device logged in with your credentials

GitHub codespaces can be given setup `.json` files that dictate their environment

As the `codespace` virtual machine runs in the cloud you can technically code on any device you wish, regardless of its power

# Hiding HTML Elements Dynamically using Javascript and CSS

You can hide elements in HTML dynamically using Javascript to set CSS property `display` of the element to `"none"` as in ```item.style.display = "none"```

```javascript
function filterItems(tag) {

  // Select all elements with the class "item"
  const items = document.querySelectorAll(".item");

  // Iterate over all items
  items.forEach((item) => {

    // Extract tags from item's dataset, stored as a space delimited list
    const tags = item.dataset.tags.split(" ");

    // Check if the specified tag is present in the item's tags
    if (tags.includes(tag)) {
      item.style.display = "inline-block"; // If yes, display the item
    } else {
      item.style.display = "none"; // If not, hide the item
    }
  });
}
```
In the example above, items are only displayed if one of their tags matches the filtered tag in `filterItems(tag)`. In this way HTML elements can be hidden from a search bar or button

# Converting Markdown Text to HTML Using Showdown and Javascript

## Information About Importing Javascript via CDN / NPM
There are multiple ways to import a script in HTML / Javascript, but a simple way is to import it via a content delivery network (CDN) such as **jsDelivr**. The search function for **jsDelivr** can be found [here](https://www.jsdelivr.com/). In simple terms **jsDelivr** pulls packages from the NPM (Node Package Manager) registry, it automatically handles versioning and caching. When you reference a specific version of a package, jsDelivr can serve that version with appropriate caching headers, ensuring that users receive the correct and cached version of the asset.

The example below imports `showdown.min.js` before `script.js` so that `script.js` can access **Showdown**.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Notes</title>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/showdown@2.1.0/dist/showdown.min.js"></script>
  <script src="script.js"></script>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
```

## Using Showdown in Javascript

The core of **Showdown** is using `converter = new Showdown.converter()` to create a converter object and using `html = converter.makeHtml(text);` to convert markdown strings using the converter object, as with the example below.

```javascript
// Store test markdown string as variable
var text = "Markdown **rocks**";

// Store showdown converter object as variable
var converter = new Showdown.converter();

// Convert markdown to html and store html content as variable
var html = converter.makeHtml(text);
```

import os
# __DIR__ contains the actual directory that this file is in.
__DIR__ = getattr(sys, '_MEIPASS', os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__)))

# ...

# Now you can access your image this way (and it will work on all platforms 😃):
tkinter.PhotoImage(file =  os.path.join(__DIR__, "Images", "btnOK.png"))


In order to preview a markdown file in **VSCode** use `CTRL` + `SHIFT` + `V`

The **link syntax** `[Link Text](website URL)` in markdown is similar to the **image syntax** except that the image syntax requires an exclamation point `!` to denote that the link is an image: `![alt text](image URL "title")` where `title` is the name of the image and `alt text` is the text that will display if the image cannot be loaded

In order to view a local image in markdown use `![alt text](local_image.png "title")` where `local_image.png` is found in the same directory as the markdown file

The image can be seen below:  
![alt text](local_image.png "Title")

To add a new line in markdown add a double space at the end of a line: `line ends` ` ` ` `

### Curiousities
- GitHub pages
- GitHub packages
    - Can allow you to work with a consistent set of interconnected packages
        - Consistent workspace across multiple projects
        - You can `pip install` GitHub packages directly via URL
        - git+https://github.com/jkbr/httpie.git#egg=httpie
        - Remember the egg thing as it names the project
        - Or `pip install --upgrade https://github.com/jkbr/httpie/tarball/master`
        - Or `git clone https://github.com/jkbr/httpie.git` and `python setup.py install`
- GitHub codespaces
    - https://github.com/agapasieka/cfg-project-group5
- GitHub suggested workflows
- Learn GitHub branches
- Installing Python package from a GitHub repo
    - force-reinstall
    - Install upgrade
    - Install from branch or tag
    - So you could force reinstall your package from the experimental branch to test new features
    - Remember editable and egg
- SSH
- GitHub remote repositories
- "Remote environment thing"
- src layout for a Python package has tests outside your package and so will not run via local files, only via installed package, but then users cannot run tests, so include if you want
- src layout means local directory files that are on python path do not include your package, therefore you will have to install the package
- Dependabot
- https://about.readthedocs.com/?ref=readthedocs.org
- exit is a helper for the interactive shell - sys.exit is intended for use in programs.
- `Poetry` for package management in `Python` [here](https://python-poetry.org/)
- What on fuck is a wheel

# Package Entry Points
```
5. entry_points (Optional)
If your package includes command-line tools or scripts, you can define entry points for these. For example:

python
Copy code
entry_points={
    'console_scripts': [
        'my-command = mypackage.module:function',
    ],
},
```

In command line `python -c "from template_package.moduleA import test; test()"`

Without using tools such as `Poetry`

The `pyproject.toml` file tells build frontend tools like pip and build which backend to use for your project. Below are some examples for common build backends, but check your backend’s own documentation for more details.

pyproject.toml as the Modern Standard:

Introduced by PEP 518, pyproject.toml

```
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=61.0"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"
```

Therefore you don't really need both setup.py and pyproject.toml

pyproject.toml is the new standardized format to describe project metadata declaratively, introduced with PEP 621. It's easier to work with and allows for shared configuration between different tools.

setup.py is the old de facto standard for packaging. Its main downside is that it requires you to run arbitrary, possibly untrusted Python code to even figure out what the project you're dealing with is and how to build it.

setup.cfg is a convenience feature in setuptools, the library usually used for writing setup.py files, which allows for a more declarative format, but still requires a setup.py even if it just calls one function.

From what I understand, they are all the same, just written differently

Incorrect.

A package can work with setup.py only

Also incorrect.

so why use all of them?

You don't, you pick one.

setup.py is literally the Python script that will install the package. It is customary to use various setuptools methods and a standardized set of data inside, but that's not required. You can manually install a package by downloading it and executing setup.py, which is what setuptools (and therefore pip) does with several other safeguards and sophistication.

Therefore, setup.py contains enough information to describe a package but contains almost no information on a project. Many sidecar formats were used to remedy this, including setup.cfg. These contain the project information missing from setup.py that allows for other tools to work. However, this usually meant that much information was shared between the two files, which made things cumbersome.

Thus was born pyproject.toml, where package and project information are combined into a single source. This file improves usability and clarity and solves the duplicated information issue. The file data is also generalized so that any tool can use it as a data store. You can **produce a setup.py using a pyproject.toml** as the latter has at least as much information as the former requires, and many tools do this for backwards-compatible packages. However, it's entirely possible (and is the direction Python packaging is moving) to use pyproject.toml directly. That is, pyproject.toml describes what you want to happen, while setup.py describes how. By letting the installation tools make intelligent choices on how to install the package pyproject.toml avoids many issues that setup.py currently causes.

Overall, just use poetry or some other project-management tool and let it deal with your project dependencies.

# HTML

- ARIA stands for **Accessible Rich Internet Applications** and is often found in HTML tags such as `<button type="button" data-key="q" aria-label="add q" aria-disabled="false">q</button>`
    - It is used primarily for accessibility purposes, such as for screen readers

- Classes in HTML can be strung together, separated by spaces, and styles will be inherited from all given classes
    - Order in the stylesheet will matter if two classes affect the same style
    - JavaScript can alter classes using `classList.add()`, `classList.remove()` and `classList.toggle()`
    - HTML / CSS have a specificity scoring system to calculate the styling system that takes precedence

- HTML allows custom data attributes in the format `data-*`, it can be anything you want really `data-state`, `data-name`, `data-something` etc.

- CSS outlines are annoying because they change element size and layout, try  `box-shadow` instead with `inset` keyword such as `box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 2px #3A3A3C`
  - The third zero stops it being `shadowy` and makes it a solid fill colour
  - Creates an inset outline with no change to size or layout

- You can make a div act as button by giving it role="button" and tabindex="0" which makes it focusable for user

- Use `<button type="button">` to stop button from submitting a form, which is the default

- In JavaScript `let` is `block-scoped`and is only accessible in the block it is declared, such as a `for-loop` or `conditional`

# Python Slice() Function for Named Slicing

In Python, the `slice()` function is a powerful tool for creating slices or sub-sequences of sequences like lists, strings, or tuples. It provides a convenient way to define named slices, making your code more readable and expressive.

## Basic Usage

The `slice()` function takes three parameters: `start`, `stop`, and `step`. These parameters represent the start index, stop index, and step value of the slice, respectively.

```python
# Using slice() for named slicing
my_slice = slice(start, stop, step)
result = sequence[my_slice]

# Named slicing using slice()
last_five = slice(-5, None)  # Creating a named slice for the last five elements
result = my_list[last_five]  # Equivalent to my_list[-5:]
```

When creating a slice using `slice(start, stop, step)`, if you use `None` for the `stop` parameter, it indicates that the slice should include all elements from the specified `start` index up to the end of the sequence.

# Slice Assignment in Python

Slice assignment allows modifying parts of a list in place using the syntax `my_list[start:stop] = new_values`.

The original list maintains its space in memory, hence the operations is considered in place, even if it occurs within a function.

```python
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

def foo(lst):
    lst[1:4] = [8, 9, 10]  # Replaces elements at index 1 to 3 with [8, 9, 10]
    lst[:] = [4, 5, 6] # Replaces the entire list with the list [4, 5, 6]
```

Slice assignment is a concise and efficient way to replace a list or update specific portions of a list without the use of the global keyword

Process if a module is not recognised in CMD (Here we use Pyinstaller as the example)

Check Installation Location:
Ensure that the location where PyInstaller is installed is included in your system's PATH environment variable.

Add PyInstaller to PATH:
You can manually add the directory containing the PyInstaller executable to your PATH. For example, if PyInstaller is installed in C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\Packages\pythonsoftwarefoundation.python.3.10_qbz5n2kfra8p0\LocalCache\Local-packages\Python310\Scripts, you should add this path to the system's PATH.

To add a directory to the PATH in Windows, you can follow these steps:

Right-click on "This PC" or "Computer" and select "Properties."
Click on "Advanced system settings."
Click on the "Environment Variables" button.
In the "System variables" section, find the "Path" variable and click "Edit."
Click "New" and add the path to the directory containing PyInstaller.
Restart Command Prompt or Shell:
After modifying the PATH, close and reopen your Command Prompt or shell to apply the changes.

Verify PyInstaller Installation:
Once you've added the directory to the PATH, open a new Command Prompt and try running pyinstaller --version again. It should now recognize the command.

If the issue persists, make sure there are no typos in the directory path you added to the PATH variable. If you encounter any problems, feel free to provide more details, and I'll do my best to assist you.
