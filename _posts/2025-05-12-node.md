# Node, NPM, NVM and NPX
- `node` (`Node.js`) is a cross-platform `JavaScript` runtime environment for running `JavaScript` outside of the browser, allowing for server-side functionality, it can be though of as being similar to the `Python` interpreter
- `npm` (`Node Package Manager`) refers to both the default package manager for `node` and an online registry of `JavaScript` packages
  - As a software, `npm` is a command-line utility bundled with `node` which manages `JavaScript` dependencies in your project
  - As an online registry it contains over a million open-source `JavaScript` packages
- `nvm` (`Node Version Manager`) is a tool that helps you install and switch between different versions of `node` / `npm`
- `npx` (`Node Package Execute`) is packaged with `node` and is a tool to run `npm` packages without installing it globally
  - `npm view create-react-app` will check if the package `create-react-app` exists on the `npm` registry, note that `npm` is used here not `npx`
  - `npx create-react-app my-app` will first search locally, theng globally, then fetch the `npm` package `create-react-app` from the `npm` registry, and run it

## General Information
When a project specifies a `node` version, this is similar to specifying a version for a `Python` project, where it assumed the modules were written to be compatible with that version.

The `node` version can be switched using `nvm`, which also changes the corresponding version of `npm`, and you can check the current version via `node -v`.

Many packages aren't `node` version specific, but as `JavaScript` has evolved (ES6, ES7...) new features have been added and some packages may require a newer a `node` version to use these new language features

> [!NOTE]
> Switching `node` version for a project is done manually. If the project has an `.nvmrc` file, `nvm use` will follow it, otherwise specify a version eg. `nvm use x.y.z`

## Installation
The first thing to install on a new machine is `Node Version Manager` (`nvm`). `nvm` was built for `Unix-based systems` such as `maxOS` / `Linux` but there is an unofficial `Windows` version that can be found on `GitHub` [here](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows). Once `nvm` is installed on your machine you should be able to install `node` / `npm` / `npx` using the commands below

## Commands
Below are some useful example commands for `nvm`, `node`, `npm` and `npx`

### Node Version Manager (nvm)
- `nvm -v` shows the current `nvm` version
- `nvm list` shows the installed `node` versions `nvm` can switch between
- `nvm current` shows the currently active `node` version
- `nvm install` installs a given version of `node`
  - `nvm install 24.0.0` installs `node` verson 24.0.0
  - `nvm install latest` installs the latest version of `node`
- `nvm use` sets the currently used `node` version
  - `nvm use 24.0.0` sets currently used `node` to version 24.0.0
  - `nvm use latest` sets currently used `node` to the latest version
- `nvm uninstall` uninstalls a given version of `node`
  - `nvm uninstall 24.0.0` uninstalls `node` verson 24.0.0

### Node.js (node)
`node -v` shows the current `node` version

### Node Package Manager (npm)
- `npm -v` shows the current `npm` version
- `npm init` initialises a `node` project in the current directory
- `npm install` installs all dependencies found in `package.json` from the `npm` registry to `node_modules`
- `npm install {package_name}` installs a specific module from the `npm` registry to `node_modules`
- `npm list` shows all locally installed packages for the current project
- `npm init -y` runs `npm init` with the default options
- `npm config edit` will allow you to edit your `npm init` default options, or you can edit manually as below
  - `npm set init.author.name "Your name"`
  - `npm set init.author.email "your@email.com"`
  - `npm set init.author.url "https://your-url.com"`
  - `npm set init.license "MIT"`
  - `npm set init.version "1.0.0"`
- `npm view {package-name}` shows details about a specific package on the `npm` registry

### Node Package Execute (npx)
- `npx -v` shows the current `npx` version
- `npx {package-name} {other-arguments}` runs a specific package from the `npm` registry without installing it

# Miscellaneous
  
#### Example Project Setup
To initialise a `node` project in the current directory with some necessary files for `GitHub` repository, use some variant of the commands below
```powershell
npx license mit > LICENSE
npx gitignore node
npm init -y
```
