# Using Node for JavaScript REPL
A [read–eval–print loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop), or REPL, is an interactive shell / environment that allows for code execution line by line in a terminal

## Entering the Node REPL Environment
```cmd
C:\Users\Ben>node
Welcome to Node.js v24.0.0.
Type ".help" for more information.
> 
```

## Help
Use `.help` to bring up the help menu, the menu is quite simple so I have inclided it below for `Node.js v24.0.0`

```cmd
> .help
.break    Sometimes you get stuck, this gets you out
.clear    Alias for .break
.editor   Enter editor mode
.exit     Exit the REPL
.help     Print this help message
.load     Load JS from a file into the REPL session
.save     Save all evaluated commands in this REPL session to a file

Press Ctrl+C to abort current expression, Ctrl+D to exit the REPL
```

## Importing Scripts from PATH
```cmd
> require('my-tools.js')   // looks for my-tools.js on PATH
> require('my-tools')      // looks for my-tools/index.js on PATH
```

## Hotkeys
- `Control + L` => Clear the console
- `Control + C` => Abort current expression
- `Control + C then Control + C` => Exit the REPL
- `Control + D` => Exit the REPL

## Autocomplete
There is an autocomplete feature when in the REPL, this works using the `Tab` key as you would expect. However, it also works automatically to show you its guesses, this can be seen below the line you type on in the example below where I have typed `Math.ran` and it shows `[Function: random]` as what would autocomplete when I hit `Tab`. For this reason it's actually quite a helpful environment for quick code.

```cmd
> Math.ran
[Function: random]
```

## Miscellaneous

**Checking Node Version**
```cmd
C:\Users\Ben>node -v
v24.0.0
```
