# GitHub Wikis
Honestly, and to cut to the chase, `GitHub` wikis in their current state are utterly mid.

- Your repository must be public
- Your wiki structure cannot have folders
- Your "foldered" files must be done via prefixing "folder-filename"
- The home page of your wiki is handled by the special file `Home.md`
- The layout of your wiki is handled by the special file `_Sidebar.md` file
- The footer on all pages of your wiki is handled by the special file `_Footer.md` file

Due to the utterly terrible system for foldering, I advise literally ignoring that it exists, having at max about 6 files in your wiki, all at root level and without prefixes. Set up the sidebar with some fancy formatting, or leave it as it is.

The use cases will be more of an extension to the `README` in the main repository, to keep it clean.

You can clone and modify the wiki locally, but to be fucking honest with you there is no point, there is no real functionality to it, and you can edit and preview the files in the web editor with the same ease. I would try to forget that it has a "repository" behind it, fill it in via the web editor, and try to keep consistent file names so that your `README` in the main project is accurately referencing the wiki.

> [!NOTE]
> - A final note, check back in a year or so to see if there have been any changes, but in its current state it is not functional as a wiki, it is just extended sections from the main `README`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - It is possible there may be some use for the wiki as an image storage! If you clone the wiki and push changes with image files, and links to images they should be usable and linkable [CITATION NEEDED]
