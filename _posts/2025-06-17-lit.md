# Lit
[`Lit`](https://lit.dev/) is a lightweight `JavaScript` library for building reusable `Web Components`. The best place to test it is at the [`Lit Playground`](https://lit.dev/playground/#sample=examples/hello-world).

An example structure of a `LitElement` is very similar to that of a regular custom element in `JavaScript`, but a fair amount of the heavy-lifting is done by `Lit`, such as `parsing`, `diffing`, and `DOM` updates. Additionally `Lit` handles automatically adding a "shadow `DOM`" to each element, which would have been manually achieved via `element.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' })`.

Just as with a regular custom element it is essential to add the line `customElements.define('custom-element', CustomElement)` after defining the class, as this is what is used to ensure the `HTML` recognises the element. As such it is important that the script is imported before the custom tag is used in the `DOM`. This issue is slightly different if your site tags are primarily generated via `JavaScript` as the `.define` method will fire when the module is imported to the currently running script, but importing the script doesn't actually do much other than ensure the element is usable, as you don't need the import in order to use `document.createElement('custom-element')`, but without it you will run into errors in the `HTML`. It is worth noting that `JavaScript` has a "smart" import system and won't redefine custom elements every time that you import them, so it is best practice to add the import line to any connected components, and to the main script.

# A Note on `Web Components`
As per the [`mdn web docs`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components): "`Web Components` is a suite of different technologies allowing you to create reusable custom elements — with their functionality encapsulated away from the rest of your code — and utilise them in your web apps"

In essence it is a design pattern for making reusable code for `HTML` / `CSS` / `JavaScript`. There's no *exact* science to a `Web Component`, you could use `HTML` templates via `<template>` and `<slot>`, as well as a "shadow `DOM`". It is similar to writing `.jsx` files, except that here you are using vanilla `JavaScript` to encapsulate `HTML` / `CSS` in string form within `JavaScript`.

## A Note on Shadow `DOM`s
A "shadow `DOM`" (`sDOM` for later reference) is essentially a `DOM` tree that is separate from the main `DOM`. This `sDOM` is internal to the element and styling from `CSS` does not leak in or out, such that the element is only affected by its internal styling defined within its `sDOM`.

A `sDOM` can be "open" or "closed" (`attachShadow({ mode: 'open' })` or `attachShadow({ mode: 'closed' })`). If the `sDOM` is "open" then it is accessible via `JavaScript`.

Normally browser dev tools will still show `sDom` elements.

# A Note on `ESM` (`ECMAScript` Modules)
The official `JavaScript` module system, standardised in `ES6` in 2015. Allow use of the `import` /`export` syntax between different files. This can be done via `CDN` (`Content Delivery Network`) with something similar to `import { html } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/lit@3.3.0/+esm'`, or locally with something similar to `import { html } from './node_modules/lit/index.js'`

> [!NOTE]
> The syntax for directly importing, as above, is not to be confused with the syntax used in files where build tools are used. In that case you'd see something like `import { html } from 'lit'`, and an associated `package.json` file
> ```javascript
> import { html } from './lit.js';    // Relative file path => No build tools
> import { html } from 'https://...'; // URL => No build tools
> import { html } from 'lit';         // Module name => REQUIRES build tools
> ```

# Example `Lit` Components
There are some examples of `Lit` components below, from the official `Lit` [playground](https://lit.dev/playground/)

```javascript
// Original at https://lit.dev/playground/#sample=examples/hello-world
import { LitElement, html, css } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/lit@3.3.0/+esm';

export class SimpleGreeting extends LitElement {
  static styles = css`p { color: blue }`;

  static properties = {
    name: {type: String},
  };

  constructor() {
    super();
    this.name = 'Somebody';
  }

  render() {
    return html`<p>Hello, ${this.name}!</p>`;
  }
}
customElements.define('simple-greeting', SimpleGreeting);
```

```javascript
// Original at https://lit.dev/playground/#sample=examples/full-component
import {LitElement, html, css} from 'lit';

export class MyElement extends LitElement {
  static properties = {
    greeting: {},
    planet: {},
  };
  // Styles are scoped to this element: they won't conflict with styles
  // on the main page or in other components. Styling API can be exposed
  // via CSS custom properties.
  static styles = css`
    :host {
      display: inline-block;
      padding: 10px;
      background: lightgray;
    }
    .planet {
      color: var(--planet-color, blue);
    }
  `;

  constructor() {
    super();
    // Define reactive properties--updating a reactive property causes
    // the component to update.
    this.greeting = 'Hello';
    this.planet = 'World';
  }

  // The render() method is called any time reactive properties change.
  // Return HTML in a string template literal tagged with the `html`
  // tag function to describe the component's internal DOM.
  // Expressions can set attribute values, property values, event handlers,
  // and child nodes/text.
  render() {
    return html`
      <span @click=${this.togglePlanet}
        >${this.greeting}
        <span class="planet">${this.planet}</span>
      </span>
    `;
  }

  // Event handlers can update the state of @properties on the element
  // instance, causing it to re-render
  togglePlanet() {
    this.planet = this.planet === 'World' ? 'Mars' : 'World';
  }
}
customElements.define('my-element', MyElement);
```

> [!NOTE]
> Similarly to creating custom elements in vanilla `JavaScript`, the constructor cannot take arguments

# A Note on JavaScript `tagFunction`
The documentation for the `tagFunction` can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#tagfunction). They are primarily used alongside `template literals` in `JavaScript`. A `template literal` is a string within backticks. The most common use I find is similar to `Python`'s `f-string` which has the syntax `f"Hello, {name}"`, with the `JavaScript` syntax for the same being `` `Hello, ${name}` ``.

A `tagFunction` is a special function that processes a `template literal`. When you write a "tagged template" like `` html`Hello, ${name}` ``, you are using the `tagFunction` (`html`) on the `template literal`. The `tagFunction` (`html`) receives the raw string parts and the values of the embedded expressions separately, allowing it to customise how the final output is constructed. In the case of `Lit` it is enabling features like safe `HTML` rendering / parsing. It creates a template object that `Lit` can efficiently update and render to the DOM.

# A Note on `diffing`
The `properties` attribute of the custom element class above is a list of "reactive" properties to listen for / observe. When one of these properties changes, the `render()` method is called to update and re-render only the parts of the element that changed. This selective approach to updating elements in the `DOM` is part of `diffing`, where two files are compared to see where they differ.

This is a case of single element `diffing`, `Lit` sees a reactive property ("reactive prop") has changed and calls the `render()` method to get the new html template from `html`, which is a `tagFunction`, as in the line ``return html`...` ``. With this new html template `Lit` will "diff" it against the previous template and update only the specific parts of the element that changed, not all elements within it.

This is a fine-tuned / lightweight single element approach to `diffing` and is contrasted by the approach taken by `React` and similar, which use a virtual `DOM` and perform `diffing` on that full document, only updating the parts of the real `DOM` where changes are found.

# Miscellaneous
- For testing purposes you can get by with the `CDN` version `import { LitElement, html, css} from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/lit@3.3.0/+esm'`, otherwise you can install via `npm` and use a build tool
- At the time of writing the current version is `Lit v3.3.0`, you can find the `CDN` version [here](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/lit)
- Tested on `Google Chrome Version 137.0.7151.104 (Official Build) (64-bit)`
- You can find a "starter kit" [here](https://github.com/lit/lit-element-starter-js) but the actual repository layout is quite bloated for a simple learning project
