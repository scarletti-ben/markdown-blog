# What is `React`

# What is `Vite`










```markdown
# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# Frameworks and Build Tools

## What is a Framework?
In general, a framework is a structured set of tools that provides a foundation for creating software
- The tools for the framework are usually in the form of libraries
- There are usually accepted conventions for how to use the framework, and where your code "fits in"

In web development, a framework is a pre-built structure of code that provides tools, libraries, and conventions to create and organise web applications efficiently and in a consistent way. You can always add new libraries / plugins, and make changes to the setup but you should be able to generate usable output with the base set of tools and associated commands.

As frameworks are templates of sorts they are usually installed via command-line eg. `npm create vite@latest my-app` for `Vite / React` app in `JavaScript` or `django-admin startproject myproject` for a `Django` project in `Python`. These commands usually create the directory and file structure of the project. Not all frameworks have these commands, or as rigid of a directory structure, but it is very common.

> [!NOTE]
> Not all frameworks are full-stack, sometimes they only cover part of the project and you may need to interleave different frameworks in order to "create your stack"

## What is a Build Tool?
A build tool is software that automates the process of preparing your code for production. It takes your source code and transforms it into optimised files that browsers can efficiently run. Build tools are essential for modern web development because they bridge the gap between developer-friendly code and production-ready, optimised files.

### Uses of Build Tools

**Development**
- Provide a development server to serve files locally, via `localhost`
- Provide `Hot Module Replacement` (`HMR`) where updates in the code show up in browser without full refresh
- Provide `source maps` which allow you to debug transpiled code by mapping back to original source

**Transpilation**
- Transform `TypeScript` to `JavaScript`
- Process `JSX` into `JavaScript`
- Convert modern `JavaScript` (ES6+) to older versions for browser compatibility
- Convert `Sass`/`SCSS` to `CSS`

**Bundling**
- Combine multiple files into fewer files
- Resolve `import` / `export` statements
- Create optimised bundles for faster loading

**Optimisation**
- `Minification` - Remove whitespace, comments, and shorten variable names
- `Tree shaking` - Remove unused code
- `Code splitting` - Break large bundles into smaller chunks
- `Asset optimisation` - Compress images, fonts, and other assets

### Common Build Tools:
- `Webpack` - Powerful and highly configurable bundler that is used by many frameworks
- `Parcel` - Zero-configuration build tool
- `esbuild` - Extremely fast `JavaScript` bundler
- `Rollup` - Focused on `ES` modules and "tree shaking"
- `Vite` - Commonly used build tool that uses `esbuild` and `Rollup` under the hood

## Example Frameworks / Build Tools for Web Development

### Vite
`Vite` is a build tool, and also a development server that handles routing and makes use of `HMR`. It allows you to bundle code for production via `npm run build`, and handles `minification` and optimisation of the built files. Another common use is the transpilation of `.ts` => `.js` and `.jsx` => `.js`
- `Vite` with vanilla `JavaScript`
  ```cmd
  npm create vite@latest my-app
  ```
- `Vite` with `React`
  ```cmd
  npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react
  ```

### Svelte
`Svelte` is a frontend framework that includes a compiler for `.svelte` files and has its own "reactivity" system, it often uses `Vite` for the development server / `HMR` and build tools (bundling, minification)
```cmd
npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template svelte
```
> [!NOTE]
> You can also try `SvelteKit` which is a full-stack framework for `Svelte` which uses `Vite` by default

### Next.js
`Next.js` is a full-stack framework built on `React` that includes a build tool (usually `Webpack`), the `React` `UI` library and tools for routing and makes use of `Hot Module Replacement` (`HMR`). It can be thought of as a "meta-framework", or a framework on top of another framework.
```cmd
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
```

### Vue.js
`Vue.js` is a frontend framework with a component-based architecture and reactivity system. It can be used as both a library and framework depending on setup
```cmd
npm create vue@latest my-app
```

### Angular
`Angular` is a comprehensive frontend framework with built-in routing, `HTTP` client, and uses `TypeScript` by default
```cmd
npm install -g @angular/cli
ng new my-app
```

### React
One of the most commonly mentioned things in web development is `React`, and it is often thought of as a framework. In reality it is best thought of as a `UI` library, or a set of tools for creating reactive elements, or a reactive `DOM`, for your site. 

> [!NOTE]
> Whilst it is not the point of this section on frameworks, in simple terms elements in the `DOM` "react" to changes in the underlying data, and the `DOM` only re-renders elements that have been changed. It uses `diffing` to achieve this, which is comparing two versions of something, here the `DOM` and the `Virtual DOM`, and finding the differences between them.

> [!NOTE]
> This document focuses on frontend frameworks and build tools. Backend frameworks (`Express.js`, `Django`, `Flask`) and `CSS` frameworks (`Tailwind CSS`, `Bootstrap`) are also important even if they haven't been touched upon here.
