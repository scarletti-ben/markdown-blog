`yt-dlp` is a modern fork of `yt-dl`, both of which are command-line utilities that use `ffmpeg` to download, and transcode, video and audio files from the internet

[](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Installation)
https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp?tab=readme-ov-file#release-files
https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest/download/yt-dlp.exe

Uses `Python 3.7` or above, which is packaged within the portable `yt-dlp.exe`

Requires `ffmpeg` to be installed on your system, and accessible via `PATH`

Will download to the current working directory

`where yt-dlp`

`yt-dlp -h`

Audio only `yt-dlp -x {URL}`

`yt-dlp -k -x --download-sections "*00:00-59:59" --audio-quality 0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDBZsObPyWM` downloads 0h:0m:0s to 0h:59m:59s, audio only (-x), keeps all files downloaded if there is a conversion, audio quality 0 means highest
