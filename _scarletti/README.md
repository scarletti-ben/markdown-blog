# A Note on this Directory
The `_scarletti` directory from this repository was added to the "exclude" section of `_config.yml`. This is not really required as `Jekyll` should ignore it by default when building the site for `GitHub` pages, but I thought I might as well add it.

```yaml
exclude:
  - ...
  - _scarletti/
```

# PWA
Enabling `PWA` also enables the "site content changed, update site" thing as the service worker checks file changes

# Categories
Categories are folders, eg. Web Development / JavaScript is two folders deep, not in both categores - citation needed
